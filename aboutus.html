    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Since our founding 23 years ago, with the purhcase of a state-of-the-art Ferris, the company has enjoyed tremendous success. The caruso brothers, our experienced and insightful leaders, bring a lifetime of carnival operations knowledge to each and every one of our engagements. The integrity and reliability of our operations, built over a lifetime, is testified by our decades long relationship with many of North America's largest and oldest events. Our route stretches from across the Texas Gulf Coast to West Texas and the South Plains.</p>
<h2>Learn the lingo</h2>
<p><strong>Canrival</strong>- </strong>Carnival refers to the whole period of time leading up to Fat Tuesday. The carnvial season officially begins on the Feast of the Epiphany.</p>
<p><strong>Krewe</strong>- </strong>The organization made up of members who plan and carry out the various themed parades and balls. The krewe of Rex, for instance, honors the king of carnival and stages a spectacular, traditional parade on Mardi Gras, along with an elaborate ball later that night.</p>
<p><strong>Parade- </strong>For New Orleans, parades, Krewes build huge, elaborate floats that carry riders who may number in dozens. This spectacular event is something to behold, and spectatotrs get a bonus thrill as float riders toss loads of colorful trinkets along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Throws- </strong>We call the parade trinkets throws. The most common throws are string os plastic beads that parade goers collect and wear around their necks as trophies.</p>
<p><strong>Purple, Green, and Gold- </strong>Official colors of Mardi Gras. Purple means justice, green means faith, and gold means power.</p>
<p><strong>King Cake- </strong>You will want sample this tradition for sure. Sweet dough twisted and shaped into an oblong is heavily decorated with icing and purple, green, and gold sugar crystals. King cake is actually more bread than cake. By tradition, a plastic baby is hidden in every king cake and if you happen to find it in your slice, you are responsible for providing the next king cake for the party! A picture is shown in the background.</p>
